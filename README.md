# <span style="color: blue"> The best application for managing your business and your employees </span>
# About the project :
Our application deals with employee management and our working hours in an employee-employer configuration
The app contains five main departments which will be detailed below, each such department is represented by a table in Fairbase. The app contains 2 different users (employee, employer) with each employee linked to his employer. The employer can post relevant jobs for the coming week and his employers can apply for these jobs. The employer must approve each one individually in order for the job to be presented to the employee as one that was accepted for him.The employer can publish notices to all his employees that they can view on a dedicated screen
The employer and the employee can view the expected salary for that month (the employer the salary that will be paid and the employee the salary that will be paid to him).
